## Introduction
The Student Management System (SMS) Backend is a Java-based application that provides a backend API for managing student data. It is built using the Spring Boot framework and follows a layered architecture to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. This repository contains the source code for the backend of the SMS.

## Features
- Create, read, update, and delete student records.
- Store and manage student information, including names, IDs, courses, and grades.
- Secure and efficient API endpoints for interacting with student data.

## Prerequisites
Before you can get started with this project, you need to have the following software and tools installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven
- Your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- PostgreSQL (or your preferred relational database)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/StudentManagementSystemBackend.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your chosen IDE.

## Usage
1. Configure your database settings in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.
2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash

   ```
4. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080/api/students` (or as configured) for managing student data.

## Architecture
This backend application follows a layered architecture for maintaining a structured and organized codebase. The layers include:
- **Controller**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates processing to the service layer.
- **Service**: Contains the business logic and interacts with the repository layer.
- **Repository**: Manages data access to the database.
- **Model**: Defines the data models used within the application.
